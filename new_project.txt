When creating a new project, follow the following steps:

Open the DC.sln file into Visual Studio.
Open the Solution Explorer and right click on the solution and select "Add" and then "New Project"
Select double click on "Empty Project" or click "Next"
Set directory location to "X:/c++/2023/DC/DC/Projects" or equivalent.
Type the name of the project, prepended with DC and click "Create"

The following steps depend upon whether we're creating a static library or executable.

Static library:
Remove the two filters named "Source Files" and "Header Files"
Drag the project to the filter named "staticLibs"
Right click on the new project and select "properties"
In the top left select "All configurations" and set the following...
General / "Configuration Type" = Static Library (.lib)
General / "C++ Language Standard" = ISO C++ 20 Standard (/std:c++20)
General / "C Language Standard" = ISO C17 (2018) Standard (/std:c17)

Executable:
Remove the two filters named "Source Files" and "Header Files"
Drag the project to the filter named "executables"
Right click on the new project and select "properties"
In the top left select "All configurations" and set the following...
General / "Configuration Type" = Application (.exe)
General / "C++ Language Standard" = ISO C++ 20 Standard (/std:c++20)
General / "C Language Standard" = ISO C17 (2018) Standard (/std:c17)
Linker / System / SubSystem = Windows
Manifest Tool / Input and Output / DPI Awareness = High DPI Aware

Click on Build menu, Configuration Manager, Active Solution Platform, click edit.
Select "x86" platform, hilight the "Remove deleted platforms" check box and click delete
Click on the project's platform dropdown and "edit" and remove the Win32 platform.

If adding a static lib, include it in any executable project's build dependencies by
right clicking on the project in solution explorer, selecting "Build dependencies/Project dependencies".

Also add the header files and static libs to each project's DCIncludes.h
